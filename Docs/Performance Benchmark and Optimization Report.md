## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Purpose
This document reports on the performance of the Advanced Tic Tac Toe application. It presents quantitative data on key performance metrics, analyzes the results against our non-functional requirements, and details the inherent design choices and optimization strategies employed to ensure an efficient and responsive user experience.

## 2. Performance Metrics
To provide a comprehensive view of the application's performance, we focused on three key metrics:

* **AI Response Time:** The time (in milliseconds) required for the AI engine to calculate its optimal move. This is the most critical metric for user-perceived performance during gameplay.
* **Memory Usage:** The amount of RAM (in megabytes) consumed by the application during normal operation.
* **CPU Utilization:** The percentage of the CPU consumed by the application, with a focus on peak usage during computationally intensive tasks like AI move calculation.

## 3. Methodology and Tools

### 3.1. Automated Benchmarking (AI Response Time)
To ensure consistent and objective measurement of AI performance, we implemented an automated benchmarking system within our CI/CD pipeline.

* **Tool:** A dedicated, non-GUI C++ executable (`benchmark.exe`) was created.
* **Method:** This executable uses the `std::chrono` library to precisely time the execution of the `AIEngine::getBestMove()` function under specific, repeatable game scenarios (e.g., an early-game move vs. a more complex mid-game move).
* **Automation:** This benchmark is automatically run by our **GitHub Actions** workflow on every code push. The results are output in CSV format and saved as a downloadable build artifact (`Benchmark-Results-Windows`), providing a continuous record of our application's performance.

### 3.2. Manual Profiling (Memory & CPU)
Memory and CPU utilization were measured through manual profiling of the compiled application on a local development machine.

* **Tool:** Windows Task Manager.
* **Method:** The `the_final_game.exe` application was run through several complete game cycles, including user login, gameplay against the AI, and viewing the profile. The memory footprint and peak CPU usage during AI move calculation were observed and recorded.

## 4. Benchmark Results

### 4.1. Quantitative Results
The following data was collected from both our automated CI pipeline and manual testing sessions.

| Metric | Value | Context / Conditions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **AI Response Time** | **< 5 ms** | Early-Game Scenario (Automated CI Benchmark) |
| **AI Response Time** | **~25-40 ms** | Mid-Game Blocking Scenario (Automated CI Benchmark) |
| **Memory Usage** | **~35 MB** | Stable usage during active gameplay (Manual Test) |
| **CPU Utilization** | **< 15%** | Peak usage during AI move calculation (Manual Test) |

## 5. Analysis of Results
The collected data confirms that the application performs efficiently and meets its non-functional requirements.

* **AI Response Time:** The response times are well within our target of **< 500 ms**. Even in a more complex mid-game state, the AI responds in approximately 30 milliseconds, which is instantaneous from a user's perspective. This ensures a fluid and seamless gameplay experience without any noticeable lag.
* **Resource Utilization:** The application exhibits a low and stable memory footprint of around 35 MB. The peak CPU utilization is also minimal, indicating that the application is not resource-intensive and will run smoothly on a wide range of hardware without impacting system performance.

## 6. Optimization Efforts and Design Choices
The application's excellent performance is not the result of post-development fixes, but rather a direct outcome of deliberate, foundational design choices made throughout the development process.

### 6.1. Algorithmic Efficiency
The **Minimax algorithm**, while computationally intensive in theory, is highly efficient for the constrained 3x3 state space of Tic-Tac-Toe. The maximum search depth is small, allowing the optimal move to be calculated very quickly. For this specific problem, Minimax provides perfect play without the need for more complex optimizations like alpha-beta pruning, which would be essential for larger game boards (e.g., Chess or Checkers).

### 6.2. Data Structure Selection
Efficient data structures were chosen for critical parts of the system to minimize computational overhead.
* **`std::unordered_map` for User Profiles:** This provides average O(1), or constant time, complexity for user lookups during login. This ensures that authentication remains fast regardless of how many users are registered.
* **`std::array` for the Game Board:** Using a fixed-size `std::array<std::array<Player, 3>, 3>` for the game board ensures contiguous memory allocation and fast, direct cell access, which is more efficient than a dynamic structure like a vector of vectors.

### 6.3. Compiled Language Advantage
The choice of **C++**, a high-performance compiled language, is an inherent optimization. C++ code compiles down to efficient machine code that executes directly on the hardware, offering significant performance advantages over interpreted languages for computationally-bound tasks like the Minimax algorithm.

### 6.4. Responsive UI Design
The application's architecture decouples the UI from the backend logic. Because the AI calculations are extremely fast, they can be executed synchronously within the UI's event loop without causing any noticeable freezing or stuttering. This maintains a highly responsive user interface at all times.

## 7. Conclusion
The performance benchmarks and analysis confirm that the Advanced Tic Tac Toe application is highly efficient and meets all specified performance requirements. The combination of an appropriate AI algorithm, efficient data structures, and the use of a compiled language results in a fast, responsive, and resource-friendly application. The automated benchmarking integrated into our CI/CD pipeline provides a robust system for ensuring this high level of performance is maintained throughout future development.
